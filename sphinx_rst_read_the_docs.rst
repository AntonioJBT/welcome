Generate python package documentation with Sphinx and render rst docs
########################################################

- Install Sphinx, sphinx-quickstart, sphinx-apidoc, sphinx-build

- In the python package docs directory that you would've created:

	+ Run 'sphinx-quickstart' to setup configuration values and generate template rst docs. See an example_ and `First Steps with Sphinx`_.
	+ Manually edit index.rst and other files to use as content
	+ sphinx-build -b html sourcedir builddir ;  or pdf (needs the LaTex builder installed)
	+ sphinx-apidoc -o . .. to generate module and function documents from docstrings within scripts
	+ make clean, make html/latexpdf to clean and generate further builds (make is equivalent to sphinx-build because quickstart creates a Makefile and make.bat files)
	+ sphinx-autobuild . _build_html updates (use if large docs that are faster to update than build from scratch)
	+ Pull/push etc to GitHub account
	+ Create an account in ReadTheDocs (RTD) and connect to GitHub repository
	+ Some configuration is needed (TO DO) at RTDs
	+ RTD rebuilds after every commit using 'sphinx-build -b html . _build/html'
	+ If the build on RTD doesn't work try 'Wipe' in /projects/[project]/versions/
	+ You can add the '_build' dir to .gitignore

-----

If using project_quickstart_, which copies templates generated by a basic sphinx-quickstart run, you can do:

.. code-block::

	make html
	ln -s _build/html/index.hmtl .
	make latexpdf
	ln -s _build/latex/*pdf .

These commands need to be run where the conf.py and other Sphinx templates are, usually:

- project_XXXX/code/docs for the code documentation
- project_XXXX/documents_and_manuscript/ for the manuscript preparation

Annoying quirks?!
#################

For titles to appear in the ReadTheDocs table of contents they need to be as::

    ####
    Why?
    ####
    
If using '=' instead they don't seem to build...
