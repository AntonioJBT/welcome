General approach:
- The core idea is about reproducibility, integrating best practice, creating good habits and learning together.
- Reproducibility is the key principle. This (simply but not easily) requires discipline and a few tools that 
can be used and/or understood by as many people as possible.

- Our research needs to be:
	- Reproducible (same question, same data, same code, same results)
	- Replicable (by other labs using other experiments, data, analysis, technology, etc.)
	- And ideally open source, open access and open data with code that is re-usable (by us and others)

- The above requires:
	- Clear questions and hypotheses
	- Accessible, read-only data (data collection and experiments largely already follow these guidelines but the same applies)
	- Transparent, easy to read, well documented code
	- Transparent, easy to read, well documented workflows (e.g. data processing steps and analysis)
	- Software version control
	- Computer environment logging (e.g. what tools, what versions, what OS)
	- Parameter logging

- There are many guidelines and thoughts (see below for a few suggestions).

- Data analysis (of any size) should aim to have:
	- Clear, documented code
	- Ideally automation and re-usability
	- Unit testing at its basic: do my new code changes change my expected results?

- We've started with this GitHub account (https://github.com/EpiCompBio/)

- There are many tools out there that aim to put the above into practice (see list of pipeline review references for example).

- We don't need to re-invent the wheel, simply to make best use of our collective skills and existing tools/approaches.

- See the suggested tools and approaches for what we are thinking of and currently implementing/using as well as the repos and tools that are/will appear in the EpiCompBio group.
