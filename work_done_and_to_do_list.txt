DONE:
- The HPC team has installed ruffus and drmaa though, these are working. David and I have been testing these and everything seems in order. 
- I've installed (in my user space) the CGAT Pipeline framework, others may need to do this as well later on. The CGAT tools work well for me, they required some manual installation of serveral of the python libraries though. I also made some changes so that they could communicate with PBS Pro, these work without problems. There has been a recent switch to python 3 though so I have to test the modifications in the CGAT scripts. Not expecting problems though (famous last words)...

############
- For Antonio: merge CGAT Py3 and test PBSPro again.

- Genotype QC tools is currently the first pipeline we'll build at Imperial with these tools/approaches. Although not straightforwardit'll essentially simply follow CGAT and Ruffus' workflow and tools.
