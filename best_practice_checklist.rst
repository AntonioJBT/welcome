Each of these topics have quantitative and qualitative metrics that may help track the adoption of good practice and monitor compliance with the guidelines in life sciences.

    1. Version control:

        a. Yes/no?

        b. How many committers?

        c. When was the version control started?

        d. When was the last commit?

    2. Code reviews:

        a. Yes/no?

        b. Star rating based on code description

    3. Automated testing:

        a. Yes/no?

        b. Coverage for unit tests

        c. Yes/no for individual tests:

            i. Unit tests

            ii. Functional tests

            iii. Integration tests

            iv. Regression tests

        d. Are the tests part of the code in the repository?

    4. Not reinventing the wheel:

        a. Using libraries?

        b. Using Frameworks?

        c. Describing the algorithm, explaining why known code is reimplemented.

        d. Reinventing should be documented. References to the algorithm?

        e. Percentage of code written from scratch?

        f. Percentage of code that is involved in the core functionality?

    5. Discoverability:

        a. Via structured search on functionality?

        b. Is it in the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry2 or others (e.g., BioSharing3)?

    6. Reusability of source code:

        a. Number or reuses = number of derived projects/external commits?

    7. Reusability of software:

        a. Number of citations on the paper

        b. Having basic description of features in structured ELIXIR format (EDAM ontology4) - in ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry?

    8. Licensing:

        a. Is there a license?

        b. Is the source available?

        c. Is it open source according to opensource.org?

    9. Issue tracking/bug tracking:

        a. Does it have a publicly accessible issue tracker?

        b. How long are issues open?

        c. What is the number of unresolved issues?

        d. How much activity has there been in the last three months in the issue tracker?

    10. Support processes:

        a. Are basic processes defined? Like governance, mailing list, releases, ...

    11. Compliance with community standards:

        a. Yes/no?

        b. Specifies the level of compliance, specification version or metrics?

    12. Buildable code:

        a. Does the compiler give warnings?

        b. Does a static analysis (“lint”) give warnings?

        c. Is an automated build system used?

    13. Open development:

        a. Number of external committers in the repositories

    14. Making data available:

        a. Yes/no?

        b. Where?

    15. Documentation:

        a. Ratio code/comments, code lines/document lines?

        b. Percentage of code dedicated to documentation?

    16. Simplicity:

        a. Measure of cyclomatic complexity

    17. Dependency management:

        a. Is it done automatically using a system?

        b. Does it use a language-standard repository to pull in dependencies?

        c. Is software made available as a dependency in a dependency repository?
