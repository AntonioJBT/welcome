reStructuredText may provide the best tool as an accessible, flexible, readable, plain text, python based technical documentation option.

It can be integrated with Sphinx for converting to html, pdf, etc. and for supporting multiple languages (not just Python).
There are extensions for Mendeley and BibTex for citations.

Very similar to Markdown. If webpages are the main objective maybe use this. 
For technical documents maybe reStructuredText is better. 

reStructuredText seems much easier than html and LaTex and travels much better as it is .txt and can be used as the source for later conversion.

With python+docutils+sphinx it can be formatted to html, with pdflatex to pdf for example.

reStructuredText can be transfomed to Markdown with Pandoc and then rendered as html.

Images can be pulled in with e.g.:

.. image:: /path/to/image.jpg
