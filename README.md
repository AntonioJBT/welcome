# welcome
Welcome, general notes, explanations, and the like for the EpiCompBio group.

Here you should be able to find some general ideas, approaches as to what we're planning and how we want to work.

Feel free to add your own, edit, comment, question, etc.

That plan is to build an approach that builds on reproducibility.
